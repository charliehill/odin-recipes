    <h1>Pan-fried haddock and tomato sauce</h1>
    <img src="images/haddock.jpeg">
    <p>I usually make a fresh tomato sauce to go with the haddock.</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Make the tomato sauce first: fry some chopped shallots or onion; once they’re soft and starting to brown, add chopped fresh tomatoes. Cook for a short time until the tomatoes are hot and melded in with the onions.</li>
        <li>If the haddock isn’t already breaded, whisk an egg. Put breadcrumbs all over the fish, dunk it in the egg, then put more breadcrumbs over it to form a good coating.</li>
        <li>Warm a frying pan to medium heat, add a light oil (e.g., canola) and fry the haddock on one side until it’s well browned, then turn and fry it on the other side.</li>
        <li>Serve the haddock immediately with the tomato sauce alongside it. Squeeze some fresh lemon on the fish. Serve with a green veg or salad.</li> 
    </ul>
