    <h1>Simple chicken curry</h1>
    <p>This takes maybe 45 minutes and is really easy. For family use, I make it with about 3lb of chicken so we have tons of leftovers.
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fry coarsely chopped onion (1-2 onions) and optionally sliced leeks (2 leeks).</li>
        <li>Cut pieces of chicken breast and thighs into 1-inch slices (3lb).</li>
        <li>Cut up some carrots into large pieces (several carrots, 1” pieces).</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and carrots to the onions and leeks, add chicken stock until they are mostly submerged, and add some salt and curry powder (enough to make a difference).</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, and simmer gently for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the curry is cooking, make rice to serve it with.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Optional extras</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add extra green veggies and/or tomatoes near the end so they aren’t overcooked.</li>
        <li>Add more spices</li>
        <li>Serve with mango chutney.</li>
        <li>Serve with poppadoms, naan, etc.</li>
    </ul>
